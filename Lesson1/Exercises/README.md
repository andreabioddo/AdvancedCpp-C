1. Implement in the C++ programming language the following algorithms:
a. Matrix multiplication;
b. Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding all prime numbers to a given limit:

2. The following sorting algorithms:
a. Bubble sort: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort;
b. Bucket sort: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort;
c. Counting sort: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort;
3. Initialise the algorithms with uniformly distributed random numbers;
4. Choose for each algorithm one large problem size (i.e. array dimension) and execute it on your
system;
5. Report and explain the results in a simple PDF file.
6. Use classes and inheritance for the implementation of the algorithms in task 1 and 2.


Important requirements:
1. Create separate classes for assignment 1 and 2. Besides, define methods for each
algorithm in the corresponding classes. Use friend functions where possible.
2. Measure only the core execution time of each algorithm without random number generation,
array/matrix initialisation, and any I/O operations.
3. Implement the algorithms as short (few lines) and as simple as possible, focused on the core
functionality (e.g. without safety checks, small optimisations, or redundant tests).
